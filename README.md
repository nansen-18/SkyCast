Instead of boring numbers, you get:
- Colors that **change with the weather** 🌈  
- Smooth animations that **match the mood** 🎥  
- A design that’s **simple yet addictive to check** ✨

## 📚 How It Works
1. You enter a city (or let SkyCast detect your location).
2. The app calls **OpenWeatherMap API** to fetch:
   - Temperature
   - Weather condition
   - Humidity & wind speed
3. The background changes based on the condition (clear, cloudy, rainy, snowy, misty).
4. You smile because checking the weather just became fun 😄.
